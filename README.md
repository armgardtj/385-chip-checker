# 385-chip-checker
This set of code is used to run a TTL chip checker on an FPGA. To run, you have to compile a code, connect a monitor via VGA to the FPGA, and connect a keyboard to the
USB shield. Once set up, you would insert a chip onto a breadboard using a preset breadboard configuration that properly wires each chip pin into the FPGA. Then you
would select the chip you are testing via the VGA and keyboard interface. Once highlighted over, press the enter button, and the software outputs whether the chip
is properly working or not.
